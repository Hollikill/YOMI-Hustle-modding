Copy  and modify your opponent's or your own styles during a match!

The invert option will invert the colors of the style during the match.
The greyscale option will reduce the saturation of your copied style during the match, for extra cool-factor.
The grayscale slider controls how much saturation to remove. IE: 1 is 100% saturation, 2 is 50% saturation, 3 is 33%, etc.
The tint option will tint all the colors of the style in the selected color during the match.

{"name":"StyleModifiers","desc":"Copy  and modify your opponent's or your own styles during a match!\n\nThe invert option will invert the colors of the style during the match.\nThe greyscale option will reduce the saturation of your copied style during the match, for extra cool-factor.\nThe grayscale slider controls how much saturation to remove. IE: 1 is 100% saturation, 2 is 50% saturation, 3 is 33%, etc.\nThe tint option will tint all the colors of the style in the selected color during the match.\n\n[i] For people who realize this is a fork of the StyleSteal mod: [/i]\n[i] This version contains no saving features at all, and was approved by workshop moderators before I uploaded it.

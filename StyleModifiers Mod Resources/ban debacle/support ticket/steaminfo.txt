[h1] AS OF 1.2: STYLES ARE NO LONGER SAVED. [/h1]
[i] not sure why this is such a big deal that the mod got taken down, but I fixed it. [/i]

Description:

Copy an opponent's style during a match, and apply modifiers.

The invert option will invert all the colors of the style.
The greyscale option will reduce the saturation of your copied style during the match, for extra cool-factor.
The grayscale slider controls how much saturation to remove. IE: 1 is 100% saturation, 2 is 50% saturation, 3 is 33%, etc.
The tint option will tint all the colors of the style in the selected color.

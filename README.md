A mod that allows you to mirror your opponent's selection of character and style, with toggle options for each.

Much of the inspiration for making the mod and it's structure comes from [cat's Perfect Mirror mod](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3296713084).

The [steam workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3585394092) for the mod.
